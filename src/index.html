    <h3>This Is My Lyfe</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Mitch Moore and I am a full stack web developer. Right now I mainly do .NET development,
      so I'm very familiar with tools like SQL Server, C#.NET, and VB.NET. I have done work with PHP and Mysql
      as well as a little work with Ruby on Rails as well.

    <h3>What I Know Bitches</h3>
    <p>
      I really enjoy doing all aspects of web development. My favorite is writing javascript, mainly because
      of how much cool stuff can be done with it. Although I am not the greatest at front end development, this
      is the aspect of web development that I've been focusing on as of late. I would like to hone in my skills
      in the front end, so one day I'll be able to become my own boss and work as a full stack developer on my
      own time. One can dream right!
